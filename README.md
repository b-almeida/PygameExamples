### Animation.py

Animates three blocks to move around the screen and bounce off the walls. The program ends when the red and blue blocks contact the yellow block.


### Collisions.py

Animates circles around the screen, performing elastic collisions with the walls, large blocks, and each other. Many small blocks are placed on screen, and disappear when contacted by a circle. The program ends when all of the small blocks have disappeared.


### DrawingAnimation.py

Draws a rectangle, circle, and line on the screen. The user can move this drawing using the arrow keys.


### HelloWorldDrawing.py

Writes "Hello world!" on the screen, along with various drawings.


### PygameSkeleton.py

A starting code template for most Pygame projects.


### Rainbow.py

Fills the window with a single colour, which can be changed by pressing a key from 1-6.


### SpritesAndSounds.py

Draws a character sprite on the screen, which can be moved using the arrow keys. Cherry sprites are randomly placed on the screen; the character can eat them to grow in size. Background music and pickup sounds are played.
